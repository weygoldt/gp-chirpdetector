	abstract = {Recent technological advances greatly improved the possibility to study freely behaving animals in natural conditions. However, many systems still rely on animal-mounted devices, which can already bias behavioral observations. Alternatively, animal behaviors can be detected and tracked in recordings of stationary sensors, e.g., video cameras. While these approaches circumvent the influence of animal-mounted devices, identification of individuals is much more challenging. We take advantage of the individual-specific electric fields electric fish generate by discharging their electric organ (EOD) to record and track their movement and communication behaviors without interfering with the animals themselves. EODs of complete groups of fish can be recorded with electrode arrays submerged in the water and then be tracked for individual fish. Here, we present an improved algorithm for tracking electric signals of wave-type electric fish. Our algorithm benefits from combining and refining previous approaches of tracking individual specific EOD frequencies and spatial electric field properties. In this process, the similarity of signal pairs in extended data windows determines their tracking order, making the algorithm more robust against detection losses and intersections. We quantify the performance of the algorithm and show its application for a data set recorded with an array of 64 electrodes distributed over a 12 m<sup>2</sup> section of a stream in the Llanos, Colombia, where we managed, for the first time, to track Apteronotus leptorhynchus over many days. These technological advances make electric fish a unique model system for a detailed analysis of social and communication behaviors, with strong implications for our research on sensory coding.},

  abstract = {Natural selection arising from resource competition and environmental heterogeneity can drive adaptive radiation. Ecological opportunity facilitates this process, resulting in rapid divergence of ecological traits in many celebrated radiations. In other cases, sexual selection is thought to fuel divergence in mating signals ahead of ecological divergence. Comparing divergence rates between naturally and sexually selected traits can offer insights into processes underlying species radiations, but to date such comparisons have been largely qualitative. Here, we quantitatively compare divergence rates for four traits in African mormyrid fishes, which use an electrical communication system with few extrinsic constraints on divergence. We demonstrate rapid signal evolution in the Paramormyrops species flock compared to divergence in morphology, size, and trophic ecology. This disparity in the tempo of trait evolution suggests that sexual selection is an important early driver of species radiation in these mormyrids. We also found slight divergence in ecological traits among closely related species, consistent with a supporting role for natural selection in Paramormyrops diversification. Our results highlight the potential for sexual selection to drive explosive signal divergence when innovations in communication open new opportunities in signal space, suggesting that opportunity can catalyze species radiations through sexual selection, as well as natural selection.},

  abstract = {Summary South American weakly electric fish produce a variety of electric organ discharge (EOD) amplitude and frequency modulations including chirps or rapid increases in EOD frequency that function as agonistic and courtship and mating displays. In Apteronotus leptorhynchus, chirps are readily evoked by the presence of the EOD of a conspecific or a sinusoidal signal designed to mimic another EOD, and we found that the frequency difference between the discharge of a given animal and that of an EOD mimic is important in determining which of two categories of chirp an animal will produce. Type-I chirps (EOD frequency increases averaging 650 Hz and lasting approximately 25 ms) are preferentially produced by males in response to EOD mimics with a frequency of 50–200 Hz higher or lower than that of their own. The EOD frequency of Apteronotus leptorhynchus is sexually dimorphic: female EODs range from 600 to 800 Hz and male EODs range from 800 to 1000 Hz. Hence, EOD frequency differences effective in evoking type-I chirps are most likely to occur during male/female interactions. This result supports previous observations that type-I chirps are emitted most often during courtship and mating. Type-II chirps, which consist of shorter-duration frequency increases of approximately 100 Hz, occur preferentially in response to EOD mimics that differ from the EOD of the animal by 10–15 Hz. Hence these are preferentially evoked when animals of the same sex interact and, as previously suggested, probably represent agonistic displays. Females typically produced only type-II chirps. We also investigated the effects of arginine vasotocin on chirping. This peptide is known to modulate communication and other types of behavior in many species, and we found that arginine vasotocin decreased the production of type-II chirps by males and also increased the production of type-I chirps in a subset of males. The chirping of most females was not significantly affected by arginine vasotocin.},

What are the basic physical laws governing electric image formation? This is discussed in four sections: temporal and spatial properties of electric fields generated by electric fish, electrolocation of small objects, electronavigation based on large nonconducting boundaries, and electrocommunication by frequency modulations of beats. Guided by the specific physics of these problems, behavioral, physical, and simulation findings are set into context. The dipole nature of the fish’s electric field and of polarized nearby objects inevitably limit electrolocation to the fish’s near field. Detection of capacitive objects as a different electric color is only possible if capacity, water conductivity and spectral properties of the fish’s electric field match. Water surface and large rocks as large nonconducting boundaries provide cues which are potentially detectable within a range of a meter and usable for electronavigation. Electrocommunication signals cover ranges up to 2 m and in wave fish are frequency modulations of beats on various timescales, ranging from tens of milliseconds to several minutes. We are just starting to understand their variety, their meaning and behavioral significance in courtship, breeding, aggression, group cohesion, etc. In addition to physical constraints, many selection pressures from predators and conspecifics act on electrosensory systems. We need more field data and need to explore the electric properties of ecological niches occupied by electric fish to really understand their adaptations and the costs of the various selection pressures.},

However, non-jamming stimuli that consist of AM and/or DPM can elicit similar shifts in EOD frequency. We tested the hypothesis that these behavioral responses result from non-jamming stimuli being misperceived as jamming stimuli. Responses to nonjamming stimuli were similar to JARs as measured by modulation rate tuning, sensitivity, and temporal dynamics. There was a smooth transition between the magnitude of JARs and responses to stimuli with variable depths of AM or DPM, suggesting that frequency shifts in response to jamming and non-jamming stimuli represent different points along a continuum rather than categorically distinct behaviors. We also tested the hypothesis that non-jamming stimuli can elicit frequency shifts in natural contexts. Frequency decreases could be elicited by semi-natural AM stimuli, such as random AM, AM presented to a localized portion of the body surface, transient changes in amplitude, and movement of resistive objects through the electric field. We conclude that ‘phantom’ jamming stimuli can induce EOD frequency shifts in natural situations.},

  abstract = {Mormyrid fish communicate and navigate using electric organ discharges (EODs). The EOD is highly stereotyped and provides information on sender identity, including species, sex, reproductive condition, and possibly relative status and individual identity. By contrast, the sequence of pulse intervals (SPI) is variable and plays more of a role in signaling behavioral states. Various types of SPI displays may be produced, including tonic patterns such as ‘random’ and ‘regularized’, and phasic patterns such as ‘bursts’ and ‘cessations’. Certain displays have been linked to specific behaviors such as aggression, submission, courtship and active exploration. In addition, interacting pairs of fish may produce stereotyped displays involving the relative timing of their EODs. The EOD waveform is controlled by the morphological and physiological properties of cells in the electric organ termed electrocytes. Differences in the innervation, morphology, size and membrane characteristics of electrocytes have been directly linked to species and sex differences in the EOD. The generation of each EOD is initiated in the medullary command nucleus (CN), which thereby determines the timing of EOD output. CN does not have any properties of a pacemaker, but rather appears to integrate descending inputs that affect the probability of EOD production. The precommand nucleus (PCN) provides a major source of excitatory input to CN and is itself inhibited by corollary discharge feedback following the production of each EOD. Changes in the activity of PCN and its inhibitory feedback neurons modify EOD output, and therefore drive the generation of SPI patterns. Current studies are addressing the mechanisms underlying the generation of these patterns and preliminary results suggest that different types of signals may be controlled by distinct components of the electromotor system. This is similar to findings in other electrogenic teleosts, suggesting that it may be a general feature in the motor control of signaling behavior.},

  abstract = {Electroreception, the capacity to detect external underwater electric fields with specialised receptors, is a phylogenetically widespread sensory modality in fishes and amphibians. In passive electroreception, a capacity possessed by c. 16\% of fish species, an animal uses low-frequency-tuned ampullary electroreceptors to detect microvolt-range bioelectric fields from prey, without the need to generate its own electric field. In active electroreception (electrolocation), which occurs only in the teleost lineages Mormyroidea and Gymnotiformes, an animal senses its surroundings by generating a weak ({$<$} 1 V) electric-organ discharge (EOD) and detecting distortions in the EOD-associated field using high-frequency-tuned tuberous electroreceptors. Tuberous electroreceptors also detect the EODs of neighbouring fishes, facilitating electrocommunication. Several other groups of elasmobranchs and teleosts generate weak ({$<$} 10 V) or strong ({$>$} 50 V) EODs that facilitate communication or predation, but not electrolocation. Approximately 1.5\% of fish species possess electric organs. This review has two aims. First, to synthesise our knowledge of the functional biology and phylogenetic distribution of electroreception and electrogenesis in fishes, with a focus on freshwater taxa and with emphasis on the proximate (morphological, physiological and genetic) bases of EOD and electroreceptor diversity. Second, to describe the diversity, biogeography, ecology and electric signal diversity of the mormyroids and gymnotiforms and to explore the ultimate (evolutionary) bases of signal and receptor diversity in their convergent electrogenic–electrosensory systems. Four sets of potential drivers or moderators of signal diversity are discussed. First, selective forces of an abiotic (environmental) nature for optimal electrolocation and communication performance of the EOD. Second, selective forces of a biotic nature targeting the communication function of the EOD, including sexual selection, reproductive interference from syntopic heterospecifics and selection from eavesdropping predators. Third, non-adaptive drift and, finally, phylogenetic inertia, which may arise from stabilising selection for optimal signal-receptor matching.},

Both sexes communicate by emitting "chirps": transient increases in EOD frequency. In males, chirping behavior and the jamming avoidance response (JAR) can be evoked by an artificial EOD stimulus delivered to the water at frequencies 1-10 Hz below the animal's own EOD. In contrast, females rarely chirp in response to this stimulus even though they show consistent JARs. To investigate whether this behavioral difference is hormone dependent, we implanted females with testosterone (T) and monitored their chirping activity over a 5 week period. Our findings indicate that elevations in blood levels of T cause an enhancement of chirping behavior and a lowering of basal EOD frequency in females. Elevated blood levels of T also appear to modulate the quality of chirps produced by hormone treated females. The effects of T on female chirping behavior and basal EOD frequency appear specific, since the magnitude of the JAR was not affected by the hormonal treatment. These findings suggest that seasonal changes in circulating concentrations of T may regulate behavioral changes in female chirping behavior and basal EOD frequency.},

The chirp rate increases when fish are presented with conspecific fish or high-frequency (700–1100 Hz) electric signals that mimic conspecific fish. We examined whether A. leptorhynchus also chirps in response to artificial low-frequency electric signals and to heterospecific electric fish whose EOD contains low-frequency components. Fish chirped at rates above background when presented with low-frequency (10–300 Hz) sine-wave stimuli; at 30 and 150 Hz, the threshold amplitude for response was 1 mV cm–1. Low-frequency (30 Hz) stimuli also potentiated the chirp response to high-frequency (∼900 Hz) stimuli. Fish increased their chirp rate when presented with two heterospecific electric fish, Sternopygus macrurus and Brachyhypopomus gauderio, but did not respond to the presence of the non-electric fish Carassius auratus. Fish chirped to low-frequency (150 Hz) signals that mimic those of S. macrurus and to EOD playbacks of B. gauderio. The response to the B. gauderio playback was reduced when the low-frequency component (\\&lt;150 Hz) was experimentally filtered out. Thus, A. leptorhynchus appears to chirp specifically to the electric signals of heterospecific electric fish, and the low-frequency components of heterospecific EODs significantly influence chirp rate. These results raise the possibility that chirps function to communicate to conspecifics about the presence of a heterospecific fish or to communicate directly to heterospecific fish.}",

Males produce longer chirp types than females and chirp at higher rates. In Apteronotus albifrons, chirp rate is sexually monomorphic, but chirp structure (change in frequency and amplitude during a chirp) was unknown. To better understand the neural regulation and evolution of chirping behavior, we compared chirp structure in these two species under identical stimulus regimes. A. albifrons, like A. leptorhynchus, produced distinct types of chirps that varied, in part, by frequency excursion. However, unlike in A. leptorhynchus, chirp types in A. albifrons varied little in duration, and chirps were all longer (70–200 ms) than those of A. leptorhynchus. Chirp type production was not sexually dimorphic in A. albifrons, but within two chirp types males produced longer chirps than females. We suggest that species differences in chirp duration might be attributable to differences in the relative proportions of fast-acting (non-NMDA) and slowacting (NMDA) glutamate receptors in the pacemaker. Additionally, we map species difference onto a phylogeny and hypothesize an evolutionary sequence for the diversification of chirp structure.},

  abstract = {I. Weakly electric fish generate around their bodies low-amplitude, AC electric fields which are used both for the detection of objects and intraspecific communication. The types of modulation in this signal of which the high-frequency wave-type gymnotiform, Apteronotus, is capable are relatively few and stereotyped. Chief among these is the chirp, a signal used in courtship and agonistic displays. Chirps are brief and rapid accelerations in the normally highly regular electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency. 2. Chirping can be elicited artificially in these animals by the use of a stimulus regime identical to that typically used to elicit another behavior, the jamming avoidance response (JAR). The neuronal basis for the JAR, a much slower and lesser alteration in EOD frequency, is well understood. Examination of the stimulus features which induce chirping show that, like the JAR, there is a region of frequency differences between the fish's EOD and the interfering signal that maximally elicits the response. Moreover, the response is sex-specific with regard to the sign of the frequency difference, with females chirping preferentially on the positive and most males on the negative Df. These features imply that the sensory mechanisms involved in the triggering of these communicatory behaviors are fundamentally similar to those explicated for the JAR.},

  abstract = {Brown ghosts, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, are weakly electric gymnotiform ®sh whose wave-like electric organ discharges are distinguished by their enormous degree of regularity. Despite this constancy, two major types of transient electric organ discharge modulations occur: gradual frequency rises, which are characterized by a relatively fast increase in electric organ discharge frequency and a slow return to baseline frequency; and chirps, brief and complex frequency and amplitude modulations. Although in spontaneously generated gradual frequency rises both duration and amount of the frequency increase are highly variable, no distinct subtypes appear to exist. This contrasts with spontaneously generated chirps which could be divided into four \`natural\` subtypes based on duration, amount of frequency increase and amplitude reduction, and time-course of the frequency change. Under non-evoked conditions, gradual frequency rises and chirps occur rather rarely. External stimulation with an electrical sine wave mimicking the electriceld of a neighboring ®sh leads to a dramatic increase in the rate of chirping not only during the 30 s of stimulation, but also in the period immediately following the stimulation. The rate of occurrence of gradual frequency rises is, however, unaected by such a stimulation regime.},

  abstract = {Glass knifefish (Eigenmannia) are a group of weakly electric fishes found throughout the Amazon basin. Their electric organ discharges (EODs) are energetically costly adaptations used in social communication and for localizing conspecifics and other objects including prey at night and in turbid water. Interestingly, a troglobitic population of blind cavefish Eigenmannia vicentespelea survives in complete darkness in a cave system in central Brazil. We examined the effects of troglobitic conditions, which includes a complete loss of visual cues and potentially reduced food sources, by comparing the behavior and movement of freely behaving cavefish to a nearby epigean (surface) population (Eigenmannia trilineata). We found that the strengths of electric discharges in cavefish were greater than in surface fish, which may result from increased reliance on electrosensory perception, larger size, and sufficient food resources. Surface fish were recorded while feeding at night and did not show evidence of territoriality, whereas cavefish appeared to maintain territories. Surprisingly, we routinely found both surface and cavefish with sustained differences in EOD frequencies that were below 10 Hz despite being within close proximity of about 50 cm. A half century of analysis of electrosocial interactions in laboratory tanks suggest that these small differences in EOD frequencies should have triggered the “jamming avoidance response,” a behavior in which fish change their EOD frequencies to increase the difference between individuals. Pairs of fish also showed significant interactions between EOD frequencies and relative movements at large distances, over 1.5 m, and at high differences in frequencies, often {$>$}50 Hz. These interactions are likely “envelope” responses in which fish alter their EOD frequency in relation to higher order features, specifically changes in the depth of modulation, of electrosocial signals.},

This input is often actively shaped by the movements of the animal and its sensory receptors. Little is known about natural sensory scene statistics taking into account the concomitant movement of sensory receptors in freely moving animals. South American weakly electric fish use a self-generated quasi-sinusoidal electric field for electrolocation and electrocommunication. Thousands of cutaneous electroreceptors detect changes in the transdermal potential (TDP) as the fish interact with conspecifics and the environment. Despite substantial knowledge about the circuitry and physiology of the electrosensory system, the statistical properties of the electrosensory input evoked by natural swimming movements have never been measured directly. Using underwater wireless telemetry, we recorded the TDP of Apteronotus leptorhynchus as they swam freely by themselves and during interaction with a conspecific. Swimming movements caused low-frequency TDP amplitude modulations (AMs). Interacting with a conspecific caused additional AMs around the difference frequency of their electric fields, with the amplitude of the AMs (envelope) varying at low frequencies due to mutual movements. Both AMs and envelopes showed a power-law relationship with frequency, indicating spectral scale invariance. Combining a computational model of the electric field with video tracking of movements, we show that specific swimming patterns cause characteristic spatiotemporal sensory input correlations that contain information that may be used by the brain to guide behavior.},

  abstract = {Apteronotus leptorhynchus (Gymnotiformes) produces wave-like electric organ discharges distinguished by a high degree of constancy. Transient frequency and amplitude modulations of these discharges occur both spontaneously and during social interactions, which can be mimicked by external electrical stimulation. The so-called chirps can be divided into four different types. Independent of the type of chirp produced under spontaneous conditions, the ®sh generate only signi®cant numbers of type-2 chirps under evoked conditions. The rate of production of chirps of this type is largely determined by the frequency relative to the ®sh's frequency and signal intensity. Frequencies of 10 Hz of the ®sh's own discharge frequency most eectively elicit chirps. Type-2 chirps can also be evoked through stimulation at or near the higher harmonic frequencies of the ®sh's frequency, but the chirp rate decreases with increasing number of the higher harmonic component. Over a certain range, the rate of production of type-2 chirps increases with increasing stimulus intensity. At very high intensities the generation of type-2 chirps is accompanied by the production of a novel type of electrical signal (\`abrupt frequency rise\`) characterized by a frequency increase of approximately 20 Hz and high repetition rates of roughly 10 s±1. We hypothesize that the dierent types of electric modulations subserve dierent behavioral functions.},

  abstract = {Signal honesty may be compromised when heightened competition provides incentive for signal exaggeration. Some degree of honesty might be maintained by intrinsic handicap costs on signalling or through imposition of extrinsic costs, such as social punishment of low quality cheaters. Thus, theory predicts a delicate balance between signal enhancement and signal reliability that varies with degree of social competition, handicap cost, and social cost. We investigated whether male sexual signals of the electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio would become less reliable predictors of body length when competition provides incentives for males to boost electric signal amplitude. As expected, social competition under natural field conditions and in controlled lab experiments drove males to enhance their signals. However, signal enhancement improved the reliability of the information conveyed by the signal, as revealed in the tightening of the relationship between signal amplitude and body length. Signal augmentation in male B. gauderio was independent of body length, and thus appeared not to be curtailed through punishment of low quality (small) individuals. Rather, all individuals boosted their signals under high competition, but those whose signals were farthest from the predicted value under low competition boosted signal amplitude the most. By elimination, intrinsic handicap cost of signal production, rather than extrinsic social cost, appears to be the basis for the unexpected reinforcement of electric signal honesty under social competition. Signal modulation may provide its greatest advantage to the signaller as a mechanism for handicap disposal under low competition rather than as a mechanism for exaggeration of quality under high competition.},

Their courtship activity, breeding behaviour and electric social communication were monitored in several groups over 2 years. Groups of both species established dominance hierarchies correlated with electric organ discharge frequency, aggressiveness and size. Spawning was preceded by several nights of courtship during which the male modulated its electric organ discharge to produce 'chirps'. Continual bouts of chirping lasted for hours on evenings prior to spawning. These electrical signals play a significant role in courtship and spawning, as gravid E. virescens females could be stimulated to spawn by playing back into the tank a tape recording of male courtship chirps. In both species the chirp involves a slight increase in frequency followed by a cessation of the dominant frequency. This suggests a common mode of signal production in these two different genera offish. Chirps are short and abrupt during aggressive encounters, but assume a softer and more raspy quality during courtship.},

Deviations in other directions may go as far as the sensory neuron, or brain theory, or aphasia, or farther. The next contributions planned for the series are: Precht, Neuronal Operations in the Vestibular System, and Movshon, Genes and Environment in the Development of the Visual Cortex. Our aim is to apU?? proach the central area by means of something like an evolving handbook of brain science. The individual monographs should describe promising and successful approaches, even in areas where the last word is far from being said.

The publisher promises speedy publication, and the editors will see that the manuscripts will be readable as well as interesting. T??bingen, Summer 1977 V.},

  abstract = {Field studies on freely behaving animals commonly require tagging and often are focused on single species. Weakly electric fish generate a species- and individual-specific electric organ discharge (EOD) and therefore provide a unique opportunity for individual tracking without tagging. Here, we present and test tracking algorithms based on recordings with submerged electrode arrays. Harmonic structures extracted from power spectra provide fish identity. Localization of fish based on weighted averages of their EOD amplitudes is found to be more robust than fitting a dipole model. We apply these techniques to monitor a community of three species, Apteronotus rostratus, Eigenmannia humboldtii and Sternopygus dariensis, in their natural habitat in Darién, Panama. We found consistent upstream movements after sunset followed by downstream movements in the second half of the night. Extrapolations of these movements and estimates of fish density obtained from additional transect data suggest that some fish cover at least several hundreds of meters of the stream per night. Most fish, including E. humboldtii, were traversing the electrode array solitarily. From in situ measurements of the decay of the EOD amplitude with distance of individual animals, we estimated that fish can detect conspecifics at distances of up to 2 m. Our recordings also emphasize the complexity of natural electrosensory scenes resulting from the interactions of the EODs of different species. Electrode arrays thus provide an unprecedented window into the so-far hidden nocturnal activities of multispecies communities of weakly electric fish at an unmatched level of detail.},

  abstract = {The brown ghost knifefish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, is a model wave-type gymnotiform used extensively in neuroethological studies. As all weakly electric fish, they produce an electric field (electric organ discharge, EOD) and can detect electric signals in their environments using electroreceptors. During social interactions, A. leptorhynchus produce communication signals by modulating the frequency and amplitude of their EOD. The Type 2 chirp, a transient increase in EOD frequency, is the most common modulation type. We will first present a description of A. leptorhynchus chirp production from a behavioural perspective, followed by a discussion of the mechanisms by which chirps are encoded by electroreceptor afferents (P-units). Both the production and encoding of chirps are influenced by the difference in EOD frequency between interacting fish, the so-called beat or difference frequency (Df). Chirps are produced most often when the Df is small, whereas attacks are more common when Dfs are large. Correlation analysis has shown that chirp production induces an echo response in interacting conspecifics and that chirps are produced when attack rates are low. Here we show that both of these relationships are strongest when Dfs are large. Electrophysiological recordings from electroreceptor afferents (P-units) have suggested that small, Type 2 chirps are encoded by increases in electroreceptor synchrony at low Dfs only. How Type 2 chirps are encoded at higher Dfs, where the signals seem to exert the greatest behavioural influence, was unknown. Here, we provide evidence that at higher Dfs, chirps could be encoded by a desynchronization of the P-unit population activity.},

Stereotyped modulations of EOD frequency and amplitude are common in social situations and are thought to serve as communication signals. Of these modulations, the most commonly studied is the chirp. This study presents a quantitative analysis of chirp production in pairs of free-swimming, physically interacting male and female A. leptorhynchus. Under these conditions, we found that in addition to chirps, the fish commonly produce a second signal type, a type of frequency rise called abrupt frequency rises, AFRs. By quantifying the behaviours associated with signal production, we find that Type 2 chirps tend to be produced when the fish are apart, following periods of low aggression, whereas AFRs tend to be produced when the fish are aggressively attacking one another in close proximity. This study is the first to our knowledge that quantitatively describes both electrocommunication signalling and behavioural correlates on a subsecond time-scale in a wave-type weakly electric fish.},

  abstract = {Animals that rely on electrolocation and echolocation for navigation and prey detection benefit from sensory systems that can operate in the dark, allowing them to exploit sensory niches with few competitors. Active sensing has been characterized as a highly specialized form of communication, whereby an echolocating or electrolocating animal serves as both the sender and receiver of sensory information. This characterization inspires a framework to explore the functions of sensory channels that communicate information with the self and with others. Overlapping communication functions create challenges for signal privacy and fidelity by leaving active-sensing animals vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming and masking. Here, we present an overview of active-sensing systems used by weakly electric fish, bats and odontocetes, and consider their susceptibility to heterospecific and conspecific jamming signals and eavesdropping. Susceptibility to interference from signals produced by both conspecifics and prey animals reduces the fidelity of electrolocation and echolocation for prey capture and foraging. Likewise, activesensing signals may be eavesdropped, increasing the risk of alerting prey to the threat of predation or the risk of predation to the sender, or drawing competition to productive foraging sites. The evolutionary success of electrolocating and echolocating animals suggests that they effectively counter the costs of active sensing through rich and diverse adaptive behaviors that allow them to mitigate the effects of competition for signal space and the exploitation of their signals.},

We examined retreat site selection in Apteronotus leptorhynchus by assessing their preference for retreat tubes that differed in opacity and dimension. Isolated fish preferred opaque to clear tubes, long and narrow diameter tubes to short, wide diameter tubes, and openended to closed tubes. We also assessed how groups of fish distributed themselves in tubes according to sex and electric organ discharge frequency under four conditions: (1) unlimited tube availability, (2) limited tube availability, (3) variation in tube opacity, and (4) variation in tube dimension. When tube availability was unlimited, fish generally preferred to occupy tubes alone. However, females, but not males, often cohabited tubes with consexuals. When tube availability was limited, females were more often than males found outside of tubes. When tubes varied by opacity and dimension, fish clustered most commonly in preferred tube types (opaque and long tubes). Males with the highest electric organ discharge frequencies usually occupied the most preferred tube type. Thus, fish have clear preferences in selecting retreat sites and groups of fish reveal their dominance relationships when presented with variation in retreat sites.},

From this wealth of investigations, we learned, first, how several segregated premotor pathways controlling a single central pattern generator, the medullary pacemaker nucleus, can provide a large repertoire of behaviorally relevant motor patterns. The results suggest that even small evolutionary modifications in the premotor circuitry can yield extensive changes in the behavioral output. Second, we have gained some insight into the concerted action of the brainstem, the diencephalon and the long-neglected forebrain in sensory processing and premotor control of communication behavior. Finally, these studies shed some light on the behavioral significance of multiple sensory brain maps in the electrosensory lateral line lobe that long have been a mystery. From these latter findings, it is tempting to interpret the information processing in the electrosensory system as a first step in the evolution towards the ‘distributed hierarchical’ organization commonly realized in sensory systems of higher vertebrates.},

One class of stimuli that are common to visual and auditory systems and, as we show, the electrosensory system are signals that contain power in a narrow range of temporal (or spatial) frequencies. Characteristic of this class of signals is a slower variation in their amplitude, otherwise known as an envelope. There is evidence suggesting that, in the visual cortex, both narrowband stimuli and their envelopes are coded for in separate and parallel streams. The implementation of this parallel transmission is not well understood at the cellular level. We have identified the cellular basis for the parallel transmission of signal and envelope in the electrosensory system: a two-cell network consisting of an interneuron connected to a pyramidal cell by means of a slow synapse. This circuit could, in principle, be implemented in the auditory or visual cortex by the previously identified biophysics of cortical interneurons.},

  abstract = {Summary Sensory systems are faced with the task of extracting behaviorally relevant information from complex sensory environments. In general, sensory acquisition involves two aspects: the control of peripheral sensory surfaces to improve signal reception and the subsequent neural filtering of incoming sensory signals to extract and enhance signals of interest. The electrosensory system of weakly electric fish provides a good model system for studying both these aspects of sensory acquisition. On the basis of infrared video recordings of black ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons) feeding on small prey (Daphnia magna) in the dark, we reconstruct three-dimensional movement trajectories of the fish and prey. We combine the reconstructed trajectory information with models of peripheral electric image formation and primary electrosensory afferent response dynamics to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of transdermal potential change and afferent activation that occur during prey-capture behavior. We characterize the behavioral strategies used by the fish, with emphasis on the functional importance of the dorsal edge in prey capture behavior, and we analyze the electrosensory consequences. In particular, we find that the high-pass filter characteristics of P-type afferent response dynamics can serve as a predictive filter for estimating the future position of the prey as the electrosensory image moves across the receptor array.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work by Moeller, Szabo and Bullock, weakly electric fish have been widely used as a model to approach the study of both spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon typically less approachable than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. Through their electric organ, weakly electric fish generate low-intensity electric fields around their bodies with which they scan the environment and manage to orient themselves and interact with conspecifics even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is probably the most studied species due to the large repertoire of individually variable and sex-specific electric signals it produces. Their rich electric vocabulary is composed of brief frequency modulations - or chirps - of the oscillating dipole moment constantly emitted by their electric organ. Because chirps come in different types, each carrying very specific and behaviorally salient information, they can be used as references to specific internal states during recordings - of either the brain or the electric organ - or during behavioral observations. Not surprisingly, this made the fortune of this model in neuroethology during the past 7 decades. Yet, truth is, this is not necessarily all true. Although established, to date this view has been supported only by correlative evidence and, to be fair, we still do not have a convincing framework to explain why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. Here we provide evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals used to expand conspecific electrolocation ranges during social encounters.},

  abstract = {Modeling the electric field and images in electric fish contributes to a better understanding of the pre-receptor conditioning of electric images. Although the boundary element method has been very successful for calculating images and fields, complex electric organ discharges pose a challenge for active electroreception modeling. We have previously developed a direct method for calculating electric images which takes into account the structure and physiology of the electric organ as well as the geometry and resistivity of fish tissues. The present article reports a general application of our simulator for studying electric images in electric fish with heterogeneous, extended electric organs. We studied three species of Gymnotiformes, including both wave-type (Apteronotus albifrons) and pulse-type (Gymnotus obscurus and Gymnotus coropinae) fish, with electric organs of different complexity. The results are compared with the African (Gnathonemus petersii) and American (Gymnotus omarorum) electric fish studied previously. We address the following issues: 1) how to calculate equivalent source distributions based on experimental measurements, 2) how the complexity of the electric organ discharge determines the features of the electric field and 3) how the basal field determines the characteristics of electric images. Our findings allow us to generalize the hypothesis (previously posed for G. omarorum) in which the perioral region and the rest of the body play different sensory roles. While the ‘‘electrosensory fovea’’ appears suitable for exploring objects in detail, the rest of the body is likened to a ‘‘peripheral retina’’ for detecting the presence and movement of surrounding objects. We discuss the commonalities and differences between species. Compared to African species, American electric fish show a weaker field. This feature, derived from the complexity of distributed electric organs, may endow Gymnotiformes with the ability to emit site-specific signals to be detected in the short range by a conspecific and the possibility to evolve predator avoidance strategies.},

  abstract = {Animal communication signals that simultaneously share the same sensory channel are likely to coevolve to maximize the transmission of each signal component. Weakly electric fish continuously produce a weak electric field that functions in communication. Fish modulate the electric organ discharge (EOD) on short timescales to produce context-specific signals called chirps. EODs and chirps are simultaneously detected by electroreceptors and processed in the electrosensory system. We analyzed these signals, first to explore whether EOD waveform is encoded in the signal received by electroreceptors and then to examine how EODs and chirps interact to influence conspicuousness. Our findings show that gross discrimination of sinusoidal from complex EOD waveforms is feasible for all species, but fine discrimination of waveform may be possible only for species with waveforms of intermediate complexity. The degree of chirp frequency modulation and chirp relative decay strongly influenced chirp conspicuousness, but other chirp parameters were less influential. The frequency difference between the interacting EODs also strongly impacted chirp conspicuousness. Finally, we developed a method for creating hybrid chirp/EOD combinations to independently analyze the impact of chirp species, EOD species, and EOD difference frequency on chirp conspicuousness. All three components and their interactions strongly influenced chirp conspicuousness, which suggests that evolutionary changes in parameters of either chirps or EODs are likely to influence chirp detection. Examining other environmental factors such as noise created by fish movement and species-typical patterns of sociality may enrich our understanding of how interacting EODs affect the detection and discrimination of chirps across species.},

  abstract = {Electrocommunication and -localization behaviors of weakly electric fish have been studied extensively in the lab, mostly by means of short-term observations on constrained fish. Far less is known about their behaviors in more natural-like settings, where fish are less constrained in space and time. We tracked individual fish in a population of fourteen brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) housed in a large 2 m3 indoor tank based on their electric organ discharges (EOD). The tank contained four different natural-like microhabitats (gravel, plants, isolated stones, stacked stones). In particular during the day individual fish showed preferences for specific habitats which provided appropriate shelter. Male fish with higher EOD frequencies spent more time in their preferred habitat during the day, moved more often between habitats during the night, and less often during the day in comparison to low-frequency males. Our data thus revealed a link between dominance indicated by higher EOD frequency, territoriality, and a more explorative personality in male A. leptorhynchus. In females, movement activity during both day and night correlated positively with EOD frequency. In the night, fish of either sex moved to another habitat after about 6 s on average. During the day, the average transition time was also very short at about 20 s. However, these activity phases were interrupted by phases of inactivity that lasted on average about 20 min during the day, but only 3 min in the night. The individual preference for daytime retreat sites did not reflect the frequent explorative movements at night.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Animals across species compete for limited resources. Whereas in some species competition behavior is solely based on the individual's own abilities, other species assess their opponents to facilitate these interactions. Using cues and communication signals, contestants gather information about their opponent, adjust their behavior accordingly, and can thereby avoid high costs of escalating fights. We tracked electrocommunication signals known as ‘rises’ and agonistic behaviors of the gymnotiform electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus in staged competition experiments. A larger body size relative to the opponent was the sole significant predictor for winners. Sex and the frequency of the continuously emitted electric field only mildly influenced competition outcome. In males, correlations of body size and winning were stronger than in females and, especially when losing against females, communication and agonistic interactions were enhanced, suggesting that males are more motivated to compete. Fish that lost competitions emitted the majority of rises, but their quantity depended on the competitors’ relative size and sex. The emission of a rise could be costly since it provoked ritualized biting or chase behaviors by the other fish. Despite winners being accurately predictable based on the number of rises after the initial 25\hspace{0.25em}min, losers continued to emit rises. The number of rises emitted by losers and the duration of chase behaviors depended in similar ways on physical attributes of contestants. Detailed evaluation of these correlations suggests that A. leptorhynchus adjusts its competition behavior according to mutual assessment, where rises could signal a loser's motivation to continue assessment through ritualized fighting.},

Very little is known about female electrocommunication behaviors in brown ghost knifefish, a weakly electric wavetype Gymnotiform fish. Most behavioral studies have focused on males, and fish are usually restrained and played a stimulus near their own electric organ discharge frequency to evoke chirps (abrupt short-term frequency rises) or the jamming avoidance response. Our study focuses on categorizing and describing spontaneous and evoked electric organ discharge modulations in free-swimming female fish that were either electrically coupled to tanks containing a conspecific (male or female), or left isolated. Cluster analysis of signals produced under isolated and social conditions revealed three categories of rises: short rise, medium rise and long rise; and one category of frequency decrease (dip). Females produce significantly more short rises when electrically coupled to tanks containing lower-frequency females, and produce more long rises when electrically coupled to tanks containing males. Short rises may have an intrasexual aggressive function, while long rises may serve as an advertisement of status or reproductive condition in intersexual interactions.},

  abstract = {The weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii can recognise objects using active electrolocation. Here, we tested two aspects of object recognition; first whether shape recognition might be influenced by movement of the fish, and second whether object discrimination is affected by the presence of electrical noise from conspecifics. (i) Unlike other object features, such as size or volume, no parameter within a single electrical image has been found that encodes object shape. We investigated whether shape recognition might be facilitated by movement-induced modulations (MIM) of the set of electrical images that are created as a fish swims past an object. Fish were trained to discriminate between pairs of objects that either created similar or dissimilar levels of MIM of the electrical images. As predicted, the fish were able to discriminate between objects up to a longer distance if there was a large difference in MIM between the objects than if there was a small difference. This supports an involvement of MIMs in shape recognition but the use of other cues cannot be excluded. (ii) Electrical noise might impair object recognition if the noise signals overlap with the EODs of an electrolocating fish. To avoid jamming, we predicted that fish might employ pulsing strategies to prevent overlaps. To investigate the influence of electrical noise on discrimination performance, two fish were tested either in the presence of a conspecific or of playback signals and the electric signals were recorded during the experiments. The fish were surprisingly immune to jamming by conspecifics: While the discrimination performance of one fish dropped to chance level when more than 22\% of its EODs overlapped with the noise signals, the performance of the other fish was not impaired even when all its EODs overlapped. Neither of the fish changed their pulsing behaviour, suggesting that they did not use any kind of jamming avoidance strategy.},

  abstract = {Sensory systems encode environmental information that is necessary for adaptive behavioural choices, and thus greatly influence the evolution of animal behaviour and the underlying neural circuits. Here, we evaluate how the quality of sensory information impacts the jamming avoidance response (JAR) in weakly electric fish. To sense their environment, these fish generate an oscillating electric field: the electric organ discharge (EOD). Nearby fish with similar EOD frequencies perform the JAR to increase the difference between their EOD frequencies, i.e. their difference frequency (DF). The fish determines the sign of the DF: when it has a lower frequency (DF {$>$} 0), EOD frequency is decreased and vice versa               .               We study the sensory basis of the JAR in two species:               Apteronotus leptorhynchus               have a high frequency (               ca               1000 Hz), spatio-temporally heterogeneous electric field, whereas               Eigenmannia               sp. have a low frequency (               ca               300 Hz), spatially uniform field. We show that the increased complexity of the               Apteronotus               field decreases the reliability of sensory cues used to determine the DF. Interestingly,               Apteronotus               responds to all JAR stimuli by increasing EOD frequency, having lost the neural pathway that produces JAR-related decreases in EOD frequency. Our results suggest that electric field complexity may have influenced the evolution of the JAR by degrading the related sensory information.},

We find that electrosensory afferents and pyramidal cells in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) lock to multiple frequencies, including the electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency, beat, and stimulus itself. We identify key elements necessary for locking to multiple frequencies, study its limits, and provide concise mathematical models reproducing our main findings.

  abstract = {Weakly electric fish use the electric field to detect objects in the neighborhood or communicate with conspecifics. They generate electric field with their electric organ and the electroreceptors sense the distortion of electric field caused by nearby objects. They use a modulated frequency signal of the Electric Organ Discharge (EOD), and it can be disturbed by similar frequency signals that neighboring weakly electric fish emit. They have a particular behavior response to change their EOD frequencies to avoid signal jamming. It is called jamming avoidance response. Inspired by the behavior of wave-type weakly electric fish, we propose an engineering perspective of jamming avoidance response model with the amplitude-phase modulation graph. The time course of the amplitude-phase graph of the EOD signal provides a cue to detect the jamming signal. We argue that the temporal integration can determine the shift direction of the EOD as well as the amount of the frequency shift to be moved frequency for the jamming avoidance response. Alternatively, as a fast adapting measure, the cross product of point vectors in the amplitude-phase graph allows early decision for jamming avoidance.

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that central nervous system neurons in weakly electric fish respond to artificially constructed electrosensory envelopes, but the behavioral relevance of such stimuli is unclear. Here we investigate the possibility that social context creates envelopes that drive behavior. When Eigenmannia virescens are in groups of three or more, the interactions between their pseudo-sinusoidal electric fields can generate ʻsocial envelopesʼ. We developed a simple mathematical prediction for how fish might respond to such social envelopes. To test this prediction, we measured the responses of E. virescens to stimuli consisting of two sinusoids, each outside the range of the Jamming Avoidance Response (JAR), that when added to the fishʼs own electric field produced low-frequency (below 10Hz) social envelopes. Fish changed their electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency in response to these envelopes, which we have termed the Social Envelope Response (SER). In 99\% of trials, the direction of the SER was consistent with the mathematical prediction. The SER was strongest in response to the lowest initial envelope frequency tested (2Hz) and depended on stimulus amplitude. The SER generally resulted in an increase of the envelope frequency during the course of a trial, suggesting that this behavior may be a mechanism for avoiding low-frequency social envelopes. Importantly, the direction of the SER was not predicted by the superposition of two JAR responses: the SER was insensitive to the amplitude ratio between the sinusoids used to generate the envelope, but was instead predicted by the sign of the difference of difference frequencies.},

  abstract = {In animals with active sensory systems, group size can have dramatic effects on the sensory information available to individuals. In “wave-type” weakly electric fishes there is a categorical difference in sensory processing between solitary fish and fish in groups: when conspecifics are within about 1 m of each other, the electric fields mix and produce interference patterns that are detected by electroreceptors on each individual. Neural circuits in these animals must therefore process two streams of information—salient signals from prey items and predators and social signals from nearby conspecifics. We investigated the parameters of social signals in two genera of sympatric weakly electric fishes, Apteronotus and Sternopygus, in natural habitats of the Napo River valley in Ecuador and in laboratory settings. Apteronotus were most commonly found in pairs along the Napo River (47\% of observations; maximum group size 4) and produced electrosensory interference at rates of 20–300 Hz. In contrast, Sternopygus were alone in 80\% of observations (maximum group size 2) in the same region of Ecuador. Similar patterns were observed in laboratory experiments: Apteronotus were in groups and preferentially approached conspecific-like signals in an electrotaxis experiment whereas Sternopygus tended to be solitary and did not approach conspecific-like electrosensory signals. These results demonstrate categorical differences in social electrosensory-related activation of central nervous system circuits that may be related to the evolution of the jamming avoidance response that is used in Apteronotus but not Sternopygus to increase the frequency of electrosensory interference patterns.},

  abstract = {Eavesdropping by electroreceptive predators poses a conflict for weakly electric fish, which depend on their Electric Organ Discharge (EOD) signals both for navigation and communication in the dark. The EODs that allow weakly electric fish to electrolocate and communicate in the dark may attract electroreceptive predators such as catfishes and Electric Eels. These predators share with their prey the synapomorphy of passive electric sense supported by ampullary electroreceptors that are highly sensitive to low-frequency electric fields. Any low-frequency spectral components of the EOD make weakly electric fish conspicuous and vulnerable to attack from electroreceptive predators. Accordingly, most weakly electric fish shift spectral energy upwards or cloak low-frequency energy with compensatory masking signals. Subadults and females in particular emit virtually no low-frequency energy in their EODs, whereas courting males include a significant low-frequency component, which likely attracts females, but makes the signals conspicuous to predators. Males of species that coexist with the most predators tend to produce the least low-frequency signal energy, expressing sexual dimorphism in their signals in less risky ways. In these respects, electric signals follow the classic responses to opposing forces of natural and sexual selection, as exemplified in the visual signals of guppies and the acoustic signals of Túngara frogs. Unique to electric fish is that the electric signal modifications that help elude detection by electroreceptive predators are additions to the basal signal rather than losses of attractive components. These enhancements that enable crypsis are energetically costly, but have also provided the evolutionary substrates for subsequent sexual selection and species identity characters.},

  abstract = {Weakly-electric fish are a well-established model system for neuroethological studies on communication and aggression. Sensory encoding of their electric communication signals, as well as behavioural responses to these signals, have been investigated in great detail under laboratory conditions. In the wave-type brown ghost knifefish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, transient increases in the frequency of the generated electric field, called chirps, are particularly well-studied, since they can be readily evoked by stimulating a fish with artificial signals mimicking conspecifics. When two fish interact, both their quasi-sinusoidal electric fields (called electric organ discharge, EOD) superimpose, resulting in a beat, an amplitude modulation at the frequency difference between the two EODs. Although chirps themselves are highly stereotyped signals, the shape of the amplitude modulation resulting from a chirp superimposed on a beat background depends on a number of parameters, such as the beat frequency, modulation depth, and beat phase at which the chirp is emitted. Here we review the influence of these beat parameters on chirp encoding in the three primary stages of the electrosensory pathway: electroreceptor afferents, the hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe, and midbrain torus semicircularis. We then examine the role of these parameters, which represent specific features of various social contexts, on the behavioural responses of A. leptorhynchus. Some aspects of the behaviour may be explained by the coding properties of early sensory neurons to chirp stimuli. However, the complexity and diversity of behavioural responses to chirps in the context of different background parameters cannot be explained solely on the basis of the sensory responses and thus suggest that critical roles are played by higher processing stages.},

We here report the opposite case where an electrocommunication signal is encoded in four distinct regimes, although the behavior described to date does not show distinct categories. In particular, we studied the encoding of chirps by P-unit afferents in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. These fish generate an electric organ discharge that oscillates at a certain individual-specific frequency. The interaction of two fish in communication contexts leads to the emergence of a beating amplitude modulation (AM) at the frequency difference between the two individual signals. This frequency difference represents the social context of the encounter. Chirps are transient increases of the fish's frequency leading to transient changes in the frequency of the AM. We stimulated the cells with the same chirp on different, naturally occurring backgrounds beats. The P-units responded either by synchronization or desynchronization depending on the background. Although the duration of a chirp is often shorter than a full cycle of the AM it elicits, the distinct responses of the P-units to the chirp can be predicted solely from the frequency of the AM based on the static frequency tuning of the cells.},

  abstract = {Interactions among animals can result in complex sensory signals containing a variety of socially relevant information, including the number, identity, and relative motion of conspecifics. How the spatiotemporal properties of such evolving naturalistic signals are encoded is a key question in sensory neuroscience. Here, we present results from experiments and modeling that address this issue in the context of the electric sense, which combines the spatial aspects of vision and touch, with the temporal aspects of audition. Wave-type electric fish, such as the brown ghost knifefish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, used in this study, are uniquely identified by the frequency of their electric organ discharge (EOD). Multiple beat frequencies arise from the superposition of the EODs of each fish. We record the natural electrical signals near the skin of a ‘‘receiving’’ fish that are produced by stationary and freely swimming conspecifics. Using spectral analysis, we find that the primary beats, and the secondary beats between them (‘‘beats of beats’’), can be greatly influenced by fish swimming; the resulting motion produces low-frequency envelopes that broaden all the beat peaks and reshape the ‘‘noise floor’’. We assess the consequences of this motion on sensory coding using a model electroreceptor. We show that the primary and secondary beats are encoded in the afferent spike train, but that motion acts to degrade this encoding. We also simulate the response of a realistic population of receptors, and find that it can encode the motion envelope well, primarily due to the receptors with lower firing rates. We discuss the implications of our results for the identification of conspecifics through specific beat frequencies and its possible hindrance by active swimming.},

While these new data sets are a great improvement, one still encounters some measurement errors as well as device failures. Moreover, these devices only measure position and require further reconstruction techniques to extract the full dynamical state space with the velocity and acceleration. Direct differentiation of position is generally not adequate. We report on the successful implementation of a shadowing filter algorithm that (1) minimizes measurement errors and (2) reconstructs at the same time the full phase-space from a position recording of a flying pigeon. This filter is based on a very simple assumption that the pigeon's dynamics are Newtonian. We explore not only how to choose the filter's parameters but also demonstrate its improvements over other techniques and give minimum data requirements. In contrast to competing filters, the shadowing filter's approach has not been widely implemented for practical problems. This article ­addresses these practicalities and provides a prototype for such application.},

Our main conclusions, based on a species called the brown ghost (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) are that fish: (1) show sexual dimorphism in the signals that they generate; (2) make different signals depending on whether they are interacting with a fish of the opposite sex or, within their own sex, to a fish of that which is dominant or subordinate to it; (3) are able to assess relative dominance from electrical cues; (4) have a type of plasticity in the pacemaker nucleus, the control center for the EOD, that occurs after stimulation of NMDA receptors that causes a long-lasting (tens of minutes to hours) change in EOD frequency; (5) that this NMDA receptor-dependent change may occur in reflexive responses, like the jamming avoidance response (JAR), as well as after certain long-lasting social signals. We propose that NMDA-receptor dependent increases in EOD frequency during the JAR adaptively shift the EOD frequency to a new value to avoid jamming by another fish and that such increases in EOD frequency during social encounters may be advantageous since social dominance seems to be positively correlated with EOD frequency in both sexes.},

  abstract = {Animal communication systems are subject to natural selection so the imprint of selection must reside in the genome of each species. Electric fish generate electric organ discharges (EODs) from a muscle-derived electric organ (EO) and use these fields for electrolocation and communication. Weakly electric teleosts have evolved at least twice (mormyriforms, gymnotiforms) allowing a comparison of the workings of evolution in two independently evolved sensory/motor systems. We focused on the genes for two Na+ channels, Nav1.4a and Nav1.4b, which are orthologs of the mammalian muscle-expressed Na+ channel gene Nav1.4. Both genes are expressed in muscle in non-electric fish. Nav1.4b is expressed in muscle in electric fish, but Nav1.4a expression has been lost from muscle and gained in the evolutionarily novel EO in both groups. We hypothesized that Nav1.4a might be evolving to optimize the EOD for different sensory environments and the generation of species-specific communication signals. We obtained the sequence for Nav1.4a from non-electric, mormyriform and gymnotiform species, estimated a phylogenetic tree, and determined rates of evolution. We observed elevated rates of evolution in this gene in both groups coincident with the loss of Nav1.4a from muscle and its compartmentalization in EO. We found amino acid substitutions at sites known to be critical for channel inactivation; analyses suggest that these changes are likely to be the result of positive selection. We suggest that the diversity of EOD waveforms in both groups of electric fish is correlated with accelerations in the rate of evolution of the Nav1.4a Na+ channel gene due to changes in selection pressure on the gene once it was solely expressed in the EO.},

Transient amplitude and frequency modulations (‘‘chirps’’) can be evoked in males by stimulation with the electric field of a conspecific. During these interactions, the males examined in this study produced six types of chirps, including two novel ones. Stimulation of a test fish with a conspecific at various distances showed that two electrically interacting fish must be within 10 cm of each other to evoke chirping behavior in the neighboring fish. The chirp rate of all but one chirp type elicited by the neighboring fish was found to be negatively correlated with the absolute value of the frequency difference between the two interacting fish, but independent of the sign of this difference. Correlation analysis of the instantaneous rates of chirp occurrence revealed two modes of interactions characterized by reciprocal stimulation and reciprocal inhibition. Further analysis of the temporal relationship between the chirps generated by the two fish during electric interactions showed that the chirps generated by one individual follow the chirps of the other with a short latency of approximately 500–1000 ms. We hypothesize that this ‘‘echo response’’ serves a communicatory function.},

  abstract = {The brown ghost (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) is a weakly electric gymnotiform fish that produces wave-like electric organ discharges distinguished by their enormous degree of regularity. Transient modulations of these discharges occur both spontaneously and when stimulating the fish with external electric signals that mimic encounters with a neighboring fish. Two prominent forms of modulations are chirps and gradual frequency rises. Chirps are complex frequency and amplitude modulations lasting between 20 ms and more than 200 ms. Based on their biophysical characteristics, they can be divided into four distinct categories. Gradual frequency rises consist of a rise in discharge frequency, followed by a slow return to baseline frequency. Although the modulatory phase may vary considerably between a few 100 ms and almost 100 s, there is no evidence for the existence of distinct categories of this type of modulation signal. Stimulation of the fish with external electric signals results almost exclusively in the generation of type-2 chirps. This effect is independent of the chirp type generated by the respective individual under non-evoked conditions. By contrast, no proper stimulation condition is known to evoke the other three types of chirps or gradual frequency rises in non-breeding fish. In contrast to the type-2 chirps evoked when subjecting the fish to external electric stimulation, the rate of spontaneously produced chirps is quite low. However, their rate appears to be optimized according to the probability of encountering a conspecific. As a result, the rate of non-evoked chirping is increased during the night when the fish exhibit high locomotor activity and in the time period following external electric stimulation. These, as well as other, observations demonstrate that both the type and rate of modulatory behavior are affected by a variety of behavioral conditions. This diversity at the behavioral level correlates with, and is likely to be causally linked to, the diversity of inputs received by the neurons that control chirps and gradual frequency rises, respectively. These neurons form two distinct sub-nuclei within the central posterior/prepacemaker nucleus in the dorsal thalamus. In vitro tract-tracing experiments have elucidated some of the connections of this complex with other brain regions. Direct input is received from the optic tectum. Indirect input arising from telencephalic and hypothalamic regions, as well as from the preoptic area, is relayed to the central posterior/prepacemaker nucleus via the preglomerular nucleus. Feedback loops may be provided by projections of the central posterior/prepacemaker nucleus to the preglomerular nucleus and the nucleus preopticus periventricularis. \# 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

He was distinguished by his rigorous analytical approach used in both behavioral studies and neuroethological investigations. Among his most significant contributions to neuroethology are a detailed analysis of the computational rules governing the jamming avoidance response in weakly electric fish and the elucidation of the principal neural pathway involved in neural control of this behavior. Based on his work, the jamming avoidance response is perhaps the best-understood vertebrate behavior pattern in terms of the underlying neural substrate. In addition to this pioneering work, Heiligenberg stimulated research in a significant number of other areas of ethology and neuroethology, including: the quantitative assessment of aggressivity in cichlid fish; the ethological analysis of the stimulus–response relationship in the chirping behavior of crickets; the exploration of the neural and endocrine basis of communicatory behavior in weakly electric fish; the study of cellular mechanisms of neuronal plasticity in the adult fish brain; and the phylogenetic analysis of electric fishes using a combination of morphology, electrophysiology, and mitochondrial sequence data.},

abstract = {Summary
The study of animal signals began in earnest with the publication in 1872 of Charles Darwin’s The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals, which laid the basis for a comparative study of signals across all animals, including humans. Yet even before Darwin, the exceptional diversity of animal signals has gripped the attention of natural historians and laymen alike, as these signals represent some of the most striking features of the natural world. Structures such as the long ornamented tail of the peacock, the roaring sounds of howler monkeys, audible kilometers away, and the pheromone trails laid by ants to guide their nestmates to resources are each examples of animal signals (Figure 1). Indeed, because signals evolved for the purpose of communicating (Box 1), their prominence can be hard for even a casual observer to overlook. Animal signals therefore raise many scientific questions: What are their functions? What information do they transmit? How are they produced? And why did they evolve?}

abstract = {Summary Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behaviour are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS and PDF).},

abstract = {A field of primate linguistics is gradually emerging. It combines general questions and tools from theoretical linguistics with rich data gathered in experimental primatology. Analyses of several monkey systems have uncovered very simple morphological and syntactic rules and have led to the development of a primate semantics that asks new questions about the division of semantic labor between the literal meaning of monkey calls, additional mechanisms of pragmatic enrichment, and the environmental context. We show that comparative studies across species may validate this program and may in some cases help in reconstructing the evolution of monkey communication over millions of years.}

abstract = {Vervet monkeys give different alarm calls to different predators. Recordings of the alarms played back when predators were absent caused the monkeys to run into trees for leopard alarms, look up for eagle alarms, and look down for snake alarms. Adults call primarily to leopards, martial eagles, and pythons, but infants give leopard alarms to various mammals, eagle alarms to many birds, and snake alarms to various snakelike objects. Predator classification improves with age and experience.}}
